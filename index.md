# Portfolio

I am a well-versed Senior Technical writer with over 15 years of experience writing software documentation across diverse industries including healthcare, fintech, e-learning, cybersecurity, and data management. I have written documentation for technical audiences like data migration consultants, QA testers, and developers. 

## API Certification 

Currently, I am working on strengthening my API documentation skills. To that end, I recently completed the University of Washingtonâ€™s Specialization in API Documentation course.

For the course, each student took on the role of subject matter expert for an API that we conceptualized and as the technical writer for an API created by a fellow student.  

As subject matter expert, I conceptualized the Refrigerator API.  As technical writer I managed the documentation project and created the docs site for the Wolf Pack Tracker API. 

The documentation source is written in Markdown, hosted on a GitHub repository, and automatically published as a website using standard Jekyll themes through GitHub Pages.

I created an API documentation usability test and managed the project plan dates to keep the documentation deliverables on track.

Working on these projects enhanced my skills in:

* Audience analysis
* Information architecture
* Documentation usability testing
* Markdown
* JSON
* Postman
* API documentation standards

## Wolf Pack Tracker

The Wolf Pack Tracker API lets you manage tracking data and collaborate with other researches to broaden your ability to assess remote wolf populations. Scientists, conservationist, and naturalists can track information about wolves and wolf packs. 

The API includes a complete set of wolf tracking data including their habitat, migration patterns, health, and prey.
